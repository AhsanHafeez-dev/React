Authentication :  It is the process of ensuring user is who they claim to be, user generally identifies themselves using email and password authetication can be one of following
types Knowledge based it is what you know pin,password or security question posession it is what you have like card,key or otp recieved using mobile app.Inherence is what you are
it generally fingerprint,facial recognition etc . bases on sensitivty there are multiple types of authentication single factor authentocation only includes one step verification 
usally using password and email and is generally considered leats secured method.multi factor authentication add another critical layer of security which means you need to verify 
otps and links.Single Sign On is that you access to multiple apps without re entering credentials sigin with google is great example of sso. password less authentication 
replaces typical password based authentication with more convernient methods like finger print physical key faicial recognition
Access Control : It is the descriptive way of defining control over particular resource so  only desired persions can access it it can broadly be divied into two categories physical 
acess control in which you restrict access to physical location like server room without authorization and digital access control whihc restrict access to digital resources like
network systems and data there are different models of access control rbac or role based acess control it give access or permission to role or group rather than individual persons
it is most simplest and been broadly used  discretionary DAC in this the creator of the resource decides who can access the resouce it geenrally used in plattform like google docs , 
colab or other multi user environmemt like linux users mandotary access cntrol in this access is generally defined by centralized authority using clearence level and no user can 
over write that abac attribute based access control decided whom have access to what based on flexible attributes and environments it is more dynamic as compared to previous
static approaches
software security minimize attack surface,prevent data theft,availability,data integrity , protect business reputation , threat modeling  secure coding secure testing vulnaribilty
management secure design pattern
malware it is a software intentionally designed to to harm computer system network or data it accesses the sensitive info like password credentials witjhout user's consent
